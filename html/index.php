                    <span style="color: darkred ; font-size:40px; " > Wine </span>(from Latin vinum) is an alcoholic beverage made from fermented grapes or other fruits. 
                    Due to the natural chemical balance, grapes ferment without the addition of sugars, acids, enzymes, water, 
                    or other nutrients.Yeast consumes the sugar in the grapes and converts it to ethanol and carbon dioxide.
                    Different varieties of grapes and strains of yeasts produce different styles of wine. 
                    The well-known variations result from the very complex interactions between the biochemical 
                    development of the fruit, reactions involved in fermentation, the terroir (the special characteristics 
                    imparted by geography, geology, climate and plant genetics) and subsequent appellation (the legally defined 
                    and protected geographical indication used to identify where the grapes for a wine were grown), along with human intervention in the overall process.

               <h1> Breif History of Wine </h1>
                <p> The peoples of the Mediterranean began to emerge from barbarism when they learned to cultivate the olive and the vine." So wrote the Greek historian Thucydides in the fifth century B.C.,and indeed,wine-making is as old as civilization itself. Just as society finds its roots in ancient Mesopotamia, the earliest evidence we have for the cultivation of grapes and the supervised fermentation of their juices dates back to 6000 B.C. in the ancient Middle East. The Egyptians recorded the harvest of grapes on the walls of their tombs; bottles of wine were even buried with pharaohs in order that they might entertain guests in the afterlife. Wine was also considered a drink of the elite in ancient Greece, and it was a centerpiece of the famous symposia, immortalized by Plato and the poets of the period. But it was during the Roman era that wine became popular throughout society. In Roman cities wine bars were set up on almost every street, and the Romans exported wine and wine-making to the rest of Europe. Soon, production and quality of wine in other regions rivaled that of Rome herself: in A.D. 92, Emperor Domitian decreed that all of the vines in the Cahors region (near Bordeaux) be pulled out, ostensibly in favor of the wheat cultivation the empire so desperately needed, but possibly also to quell the competition with Italian wine exports.

                <p>Wines made from produce besides grapes include rice wine and innumerable fruit wines, of which some of 
                    the best-known are pomegranate wine, apple wine and elderberry wine. Wine has long played an important role in religion. 
                    Red wine was associated with blood by the ancient Egyptians[13] and was used by both the Greek cult of Dionysus and the
                    Romans in their Bacchanalia; Judaism also incorporates it in the Kiddush and Christianity in the Eucharist.</p>
